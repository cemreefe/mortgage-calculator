## Mortgage Calculator

Welcome to the mid-term mortgage overpayment calculator. Here you will be able to see the effects of monthly overpayments and changes in interest rates for the duration of your mortgage. You should have to hand the remaining amount of money owed on your mortgage at the time of using this tool.

If you have an existing fixed-term rate, you should add the associated duration and interest rate for that term. A market interest rate should be added to illustrate what payments will look like after your fixed term ends. This is currently defaulted to 6%. If you have no fixed-term, the market rate will be used for all payment calculations.
